In this project, I aimed to classify games based on both textual descriptions and screenshots using a multimodal approach. The workflow involved several key steps, including data loading, text extraction from images, and the creation of a custom dataset. Dependencies included Pandas for data handling, pytesseract for OCR, OpenCV for image processing, and Transformers for pre-trained models.

**Data Loading and Exploration:**
I used Pandas to load game data from an Excel file. Initial exploration involved displaying column names and a snapshot of the dataset. The primary columns of interest were "SCREENSHOT" and "TEXT," representing game images and descriptions, respectively.

**Text Extraction from Images:**
To extract text from game screenshots, I integrated Optical Character Recognition (OCR) using pytesseract. Images were preprocessed by converting them to grayscale and creating binary images through thresholding. OCR was then applied to obtain textual information from the screenshots. The extracted text was stored in a new column called "Extracted_Text."

**Multimodal Model Architecture:**
For the multimodal model, I leveraged pre-trained models for vision and text processing. The Vision Transformer (ViT) and GPT-2 models were chosen for their capabilities in image and text analysis, respectively. I implemented a custom dataset class to handle image and text data. Images underwent transformations, including resizing and normalization, while text data was tokenized and converted into tensors.

The Multimodal Model architecture included separate branches for image and text processing. Dropout layers were added to prevent overfitting. Fusion layers combined features from both branches, and a final output layer facilitated game classification. The entire model was implemented using PyTorch.

**Training the Multimodal Model:**
The model was trained using Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) as the optimizer and Cross-Entropy Loss for training. The training loop involved iterating through the dataset in batches, performing forward and backward passes, and optimizing the model's parameters. Training metrics, such as the average loss per epoch, were monitored to assess model performance.

**Conclusion and Future Use:**
The project demonstrated the integration of vision and text models in a unified multimodal architecture for game classification. The code and the trained model were saved for potential future use. The project's success relies on the effective combination of visual and textual information, showcasing the potential of multimodal approaches in solving complex classification tasks.
